Windows 10 received generally positive reviews(普遍好評) upon(之上) its original(最初) release.

Critics(評價者) praised(稱讚) Microsoft's decision(決定) to provide the desktop(桌面)-oriented(面向桌面) interface(介面) in line with previous(以前的) versions(版本) of Windows,

contrasting(對比) the tablet(平板電腦)-oriented approach(方法) of Windows 8,

Xbox Live integration(實時集成), as well as the functionality(功能) and capabilities(功能) of the Cortana personal assistant(個人助理) and

privacy(隱私) concerns(關注) over data collection(數據收集) performed(執行) by the OS for Microsoft and its partners(夥伴),

and adware-like(類似廣告軟件) tactics(策略) used to promote(推廣) the operating system on its release.

Microsoft initially(最初) aimed(目標) to have Windows 10 installed(已安裝) on over one billion devices(設備) within three years of its release;

 that goal was ultimately(最終) reached(到達) almost five years after release on March 16, 2020.

 By January 2018, Windows 10 surpassed(超過) Windows 7 as the most popular version of Windows worldwide(全世界).

 (the rest being older(較舊) Windows versions and other operating systems such as macOS and Linux),

and 24% of all devices (including mobile phone(行動電話), tablet(平板電腦) and console(控制台)) are running(正在運行) Windows 10.

On June 24, 2021, Microsoft announced(宣布) Windows 10's successor(繼任者), Windows 11, which was released on October 5, 2021.
