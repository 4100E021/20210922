## window 10

Windows 10 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed(開發) by Microsoft(微軟).

It is the successor(接替者) to Windows 8.1, which was released(發布) nearly two years earlier,

and itself was released to manufacturing(製造業) on July 15, 2015, and broadly(廣泛地) released for the general public(一般民眾) on July 29, 2015.

Windows 10 was made available(可用的) for download via MSDN and TechNet,

as a free upgrade(升級) for retail copies(零售副本) of Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 users via(通過) the Windows Store,

and to Windows 7 users via Windows Update.

Windows 10 receives(收到) new builds on an ongoing basis(處於持續進行狀態), which are available at no additional(額外的) cost(成本) to users,

in addition to additional test builds(測試版本) of Windows 10, which are available to Windows Insiders(內部人士).

Devices(設備) in enterprise(企業) environments(環境) can receive these updates at a slower pace(速度較慢), 

or use long-term(長期) support milestones(里程碑) that only receive critical updates(重要更新),

such as security patches(安全補丁), over their ten-year lifespan(壽命) of extended(擴展) support.

Windows 10 received generally positive reviews(普遍好評) upon(之上) its original(最初) release.

Critics(評價者) praised(稱讚) Microsoft's decision(決定) to provide the desktop(桌面)-oriented(面向桌面) interface(介面) in line with previous(以前的) versions(版本) of Windows,

contrasting(對比) the tablet(平板電腦)-oriented approach(方法) of Windows 8,

although Windows 10's touch(觸碰)-oriented user interface mode was criticized(批評) for containing(包含) regressions(回歸) upon

the touch-oriented interface of its predecessor(前身).

Critics also praised the improvements(改進) to Windows 10's bundled(捆綁) software over Windows 8.1,

Xbox Live integration(實時集成), as well as the functionality(功能) and capabilities(功能) of the Cortana personal assistant(個人助理) and

the replacement of Internet Explorer with Microsoft Edge.

However, media outlets have been critical of the changes to operating system behaviors,

including mandatory update installation, privacy concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners,

and adware-like tactics used to promote the operating system on its release.

Microsoft initially aimed to have Windows 10 installed on over one billion devices within three years of its release;

 that goal was ultimately reached almost five years after release on March 16, 2020.

 By January 2018, Windows 10 surpassed Windows 7 as the most popular version of Windows worldwide.

 As of June 2021, it is estimated that 79% of Windows PCs,58% of all PCs
 
 (the rest being older Windows versions and other operating systems such as macOS and Linux),

and 24% of all devices (including mobile, tablet and console) are running Windows 10.

On June 24, 2021, Microsoft announced Windows 10's successor, Windows 11, which was released on October 5, 2021.

Windows 10 is the final version of Windows which supports IA-32 and ARMv7-based processors (also known as 32-bit processors).

Its successor, Windows 11, requires 64-bit processor in any supported architecture (x86-64/AMD64 for x86 and ARMv8 for ARM).
