Linux  is a free and open source(原始碼) of UNIX- operating system(作業系統) . 

The operating system is the core(核心) of Linus Torvalds (萊納斯·托瓦茲)first released on October 5 , 

plus(加) the user space(空間) of the program application(應用程式) later, a Linux operating system. 

Linux is also the most famous example of the development(開發) of free software(自由軟體) and open source software .

As long as it follows the GNU General Public License(通用公共許可證) (GPL),

any individual(個人) or organization(組織) can freely(自由地) use all the underlying(潛在;底層) source code of Linux ,

Most Linux systems also include things like providing(提供) GUI of the X Window program like.

Except(除了) for some experts(專家), most people use Linux distributions directlyListen(發行版) , 

Instead of(代替) choosing each component(每個組件) or setting it yourself(自行設置).

Linux strictly(嚴格) refers to(指的是) the core of the operating system, 

because the operating system contains(包含) many user graphical interfaces(圖形介面) and other utilities(公用事業). 

Nowadays, Linux is often used to refer to a complete(完全的) operating system based on(基於) Linux, and the core is changed to the Linux kernel(核心) . 

Since these system tools(工具) and libraries supporting user(支持用戶的倉庫) space are mainly provided by the GNU project(計劃) initiated(發起) by Richard Stallman(理查德·斯托曼) in 1983 , 

the Free Software Foundation(自由軟件基金會) proposed(提議) to name its composite system(組合系統) GNU/Linux , 

but Linux is not part of(屬於) the GNU project , and this name has not been unanimously(一致) recognized(認可) by the community(社會上).

Linux was originally(起初) a free operating system for personal(個人的) computers supporting(支持) Intel's x86 architecture(架構).

At present(目前), Linux has been ported to(轉移到) more computer hardware platforms(硬件平台), far beyond(遠遠超越) any other operating system.

Linux can run on servers(伺服器) and other large platforms, such as mainframes(大型電腦) and supercomputers .

The 500 fastest supercomputers in the world have 100% implemented(實施) Linux packages(套件) or variants(變種)  .

Linux is also widely(廣泛) used in embedded(嵌入式) systems , such as mobile(移動) phones , tablets(平板電腦) , routers(路由器) , TVs , and electronic game consoles(電子遊戲機) . 

The Android operating system, which is widely used on mobile devices(設備) , is built on the Linux core.

Under normal circumstances(正常情況), Linux is packaged as(被打包為) a Linux package for personal computers and servers. 

Some popular mainstream(主流) Linux distributions(發行版), including Debian (and its derivative versions Ubuntu , Linux Mint ), 

Fedora (and related versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux) , CentOS ) and openSUSE, etc. 

Linux package contains(包含) the Linux kernel and practical support(實際支援) core programs and libraries, 

usually with a large number of applications to meet the various needs of. 

The Linux package used by personal computers usually contains X Window and a corresponding desktop environment, such as GNOME or KDE .

Commonly used applications for desktop Linux operating systems ,

including Firefox web browser, LibreOffice office software, GIMP image processing tools, etc.

Since Linux is free software, anyone can create a Linux package that meets their needs.
