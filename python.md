## Python(programming language)

Python is an interpreted(解釋) high-level(高階) general-purpose(一般通用) programming(編輯) language.

Its design(設計) philosophy emphasizes(強調) code(代碼) readability(可讀性) with its use of significant indentation(明顯的縮進).

Its language constructs(結構) as well as its object-oriented(面向對象) approach(方法) aim to help programmers write clear,

logical code for small(小型邏輯代碼) and large-scale projects(大型項目).

Python is dynamically-typed(動態類型) and garbage-collected(垃圾收集).

It supports multiple(多) programming paradigms(編成範式), including structured(結構化)

(particularly(特別), procedural(過程編程)), object-oriented and functional programming(函數式編程).

It is often described(描述) as a "batteries(電池) included" language due to its comprehensive(全面) standard(標準) library(庫).

Guido van Rossum began working(開始研究) on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor(繼承者) to the ABC programming(編程) language,

and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.

Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced(介紹) new features(新功能), 

such as list(列表) comprehensions(理解) and a garbage(垃圾) collection(信息) system using reference counting(引用計數).

Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision(修訂) of the language that is not completely(完整地) backward-compatible(向後兼容).

Python 2 was discontinued(停產) with version 2.7.18 in 2020.

Python consistently(始終如一) ranks(等級) as one of the most popular programming languages.
